We are only developing apps as a hobby not professionaly, with [Prawich Thawansakdivudhi](https://github.com/SEN-SENSATION) developing server-side related stuff with NodeJS and MongoDB and [Jirat Chutrakul](https://github.com/Jiraties) developing the frontend with frameworks like React and Flutter.
